                                      <p>Features of the app includes: </p>  
                                        <ol type="1">
                                            <li><strong>Emergency request and response</strong> –
                                                connect with the designated responders depending on the emergency type and available emergency coverage. the sole purpose of the user location data is to specifically know the user location for emergency response purposes the app gets the user location and it would thene be passed to the emergency responders for navigation to user emergency location. 
                                                user app retrieves user metadata such as location data (latitude, longitude) and sent to dispatcher via API to save to database. dispatcher will then fetch the information and send the emergency details including collected location data (latitude, longitude) to the responder app. the location data (latitude, longitude) will be used for locating of the emergency.
                                                Authenticated users by means of the emergency request function module allows the user to send distress signal to the authorities and available responders. This uses the mobile geo-location services along with the user information from KYC to specifically identify user location details that would be sent out to the command center on the Dispatch admin portal to assess the situation. The Dispatch Admin Portal would then need to deploy and assign applicable emergency responders to the user location. User data including the KYC information and the user geo-location will be used by the emergency responders to navigate through the shortest path to attend to emergency distress signal.

                                    <p>Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement and except for actions for equitable relief, all disputes between the parties in connection with this Agreement will be decided by arbitration pursuant to the Code of Arbitration Procedure of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) in effect at the time of the claim or dispute and in accordance with Title 9 of the United States Code. Notice of the demand for arbitration must be filed in writing with the other party and must be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen. If the amount claimed to be in dispute is equal to or greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), then the arbitration will be decided by a panel of three (3) arbitrators selected under the Code of Arbitration Procedure of FINRA. If the amount claimed to be in dispute is less than that amount, then the arbitration will be decided by one (1) arbitrator selected pursuant to the same procedure. Arbitration will be initiated in Boulder, Colorado, United States at a site specified by us. The arbitration will occur within sixty (60) calendar days after the party demanding arbitration delivers the written demand on the other party, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. The arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrators, all of its Costs and Fees. “Costs and Fees” for this purpose means all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators’ fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, and out-of-pocket expenses, such as copying, telephone, court costs, witness fees and attorneys’ fees. The award rendered by the arbitrators will be final and specifically enforceable under applicable laws, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof. No arbitration arising out of or relating to this Agreement may include, by consolidation, joinder or in any other manner, any person or entity not a party to this Agreement. Neither party will appeal the award nor seek review, modification, or vacation of the award in any court or regulatory agency. Each party shall continue to perform its respective obligations during the pendency of any dispute until such time as the dispute is resolved. The foregoing will not prevent a party from instituting formal proceedings earlier to (i) preserve a superior position with respect to other creditors, or (ii) address a claim arising out of the breach of either party’s intellectual property rights under this Agreement. In addition, either party may resort to court action for injunctive relief at any time if the dispute resolution process set forth in this section may permit or cause irreparable injury to such party or any third party claiming against such party, due to delay arising out of the dispute resolution process. Any such legal action or proceeding shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the State of Colorado and You hereby accept, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
